        <p class="newspaper-article,column">• Energy is that “natural” property of a system which stays the same unless
            it exchanges (in or out) some of
            this property with the environment – this means the total energy of a system can only increase or decrease
            if energy is gained from or lost to the environment respectively.
            <Br><br>• There are many forms of energy, e.g. nuclear, chemical, solar, etc. – these may be transformed
            from one form to another. Modern technology is built on this idea, e.g. we transform chemical or nuclear
            energy in power plants into electrical energy, and this in turn is transformed into whatever energy is
            required by appliances in your home.
            <Br><br>• The total mechanical energy of a system E, consists of two types of energy – the total energy is
            the sum of the kinetic (K) and stored or potential energy (U) possessed by a system: Emech = K + U.
            Potential energy is stored energy a system has by virtue of its position in a force field, and kinetic
            energy is the energy it possesses due to its motion.
        </p>
        <p class="newspaper-article,column">• The law of conservation of energy goes way beyond Newtonian mechanics to
            include new ideas about
            heat, chemical energy, and about the individual energy of atoms and molecules (e.g. thermal energy Eth) that
            make up the system.
            <Br><br>• Energy can be transformed inside a system from one form into another, e.g. gravitational potential
            energy can be converted to kinetic energy and vice versa. In this case the total system energy, Esys = K + U
            + Eth is conserved (Esys = 0).
            <Br><br>• Energy transfer can occur between the system and the environment. The mechanical transfer of
            energy is called work (W), so Esys = W.
